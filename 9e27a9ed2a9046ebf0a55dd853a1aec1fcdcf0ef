If so, then pushing something with `netconf:operation\u003d\"remove\"` actually creates an edit/diff node asking sysrepo to \"keep removing a node if it exists\". Since the alarms are owned by the current session, it looks to me that this function should *discard* an appropriate subtree of operational changes, not \"push a removal\".",
