      "message": "To be honest I think that there\u0027s little value in trying to isolate the code from libyang like that. In cla-sysrepo, there was a case for making the code work even with no sysrepo around because the code focused on driving some external HW. Here, this is a purposely-built code acting essentially as a sysrepo plugin. Let\u0027s not introduce too many layers of abstraction and just consider using libyang directly.",
