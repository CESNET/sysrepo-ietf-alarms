      "message": "I find it a little hard to follow with identifiers such as time, time1, time5. Since I *think* that the majority of these require only two timestamps, perhaps calling it \"original time\" and \"updated time\" might make the code more easier to read. This might require changing `CLIENT_ALARM_RPC` to \"return\" something (see below), but perhaps that\u0027s not mandatory.",
